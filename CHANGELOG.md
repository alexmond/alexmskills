# Changelog

All notable changes to the **alexmskills** marketplace and its plugins.

Plugins are versioned **independently** — the authoritative version is each plugin's `plugin.json`.
This log groups changes by date and tags each entry with the plugin and the version it shipped in.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the marketplace itself is
unreleased/rolling (no global version).

## 2026-06-12

### Added
- **roles 1.0.0** — new plugin: a per-repo repository of *evolving roles* (`.claude/roles/`) usable
  four ways — solo (`/roles:as <role>` + per-persona skills), as dev-crew roles, brainstorm-panel
  seats, and research-sweep coverage roles. Ships seed personas (`architect`, `builder`, `debugger`,
  `optimizer`, `reviewer`, `refactorer`, `skeptic`), a SessionStart index + graduation-audit hook,
  and the shared-core convention. Absorbs the former `senior-prompts` beta plugin.
- **research-sweep 1.1.0** — joins the role system as the **"discover"** orchestrator: coverage-roles
  registry `.claude/roles/research.md`, dynamic angle composition from the information space, archetype
  coverage roles (`entity-scout`, `timeline-scout`, `source-scout`, `container-scout`) + probationary
  minting, a shared `skeptic` verifier + a synthesizer, and per-repo learning.
- **dev-crew 1.1.0** — escalation protocol (`BLOCKED` handoff + diagnosis-driven ladder), a
  machine-enforced phase-gate hook, handoff discipline, qa verify-against-reality, a `ui-reviewer`
  candidate role, and an axis-driven roster compose path.
- **brainstorm-panel 1.1.0** — a panel roles registry (`.claude/roles/panel.md`), skeptic seated by
  default, a unanimity→steelman guard, a 1-round default, pre-proposed practitioner/buildability seats,
  acceptance re-review, evidence capture, prefs-outrank-veto, and adaptive stopping.
- In-depth **Role System** architecture documentation; a naming convention for plugins and roles
  (documented in `CLAUDE.md`); a **Provenance & attribution** section in the README.

### Changed
- **Renamed** `parallel-research-sweep` → **`research-sweep`** (drop the redundant qualifier; join the
  crew/panel/sweep family).
- **Renamed** role personas to crew-aligned nouns: `build-app`→`builder`, `system-design`→`architect`,
  `debug-root-cause`→`debugger`, `optimize-perf`→`optimizer`, `understand-refactor`→`reviewer`,
  `clean-arch`→`refactorer`; coverage roles `by-*`→`*-scout`.
- **dev-crew** description reframed: the crew composes a *task-fit roster* to deliver a target —
  `architect → dev → qa → deployer` is one example lineup, not the definition.
- Read-only correctness: evolving plugins write state to the consuming repo's `.claude/` (or user
  memory), never into the read-only plugin cache; shipped `roles.md`/`log.md` are read-only seeds.

### Promoted
- **roles** promoted from the beta channel straight to the stable catalog (1.0.0).

## 2026-06-11

### Added
- Initial marketplace scaffold: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, the `plugins/` layout, a jq-based
  validator, `Makefile`, CI (`validate.yml`), MIT `LICENSE`, and the Antora docs component (`docs/`).
- Stable plugins, all **1.0.0**: `evolving-claude-md`, `dev-crew`, `brainstorm-panel`,
  `learn-on-failure`, `implement-issue`, `maven-quality`, `security-audit`, `review-agents`,
  `parallel-research-sweep`.
- **Beta channel** (`alexmskills-beta` under `beta/`) with `make new-beta` / `make promote` tooling,
  and the `senior-prompts` beta plugin (later absorbed into `roles`).
- Trigger samples and copy-paste install blocks across the README and docs.
- The repo **dogfoods** `evolving-claude-md` on its own `CLAUDE.md`.
